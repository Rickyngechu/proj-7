## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive web design.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- Tailwind css.

### What I learned

- I has been a while since I said that I would be using tailwind css,however I have found it to be a useful tool indeed.I have also learnt that the for
  each loop js can return a value.

```js
let val = "";
el.forEach((el) =>
  el.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    val = e.target.value;
  })
);
```

### Continued development

I will continue learning and developing more projects by use of tools such as tailwind css and sass to enhance flexibility.

### Useful resources
